# NU-Projects
Projects from my courses at Northeastern that I'm proud of. Organized by course.

Artificial Intelligence:

* Bananagrams AI:
This course covered many topics within artificial intelligence such as search, game-playing, 
probabilistic modeling, and learning algorithms. Over the course of the semester, 
along with my groupmate Ella Taira, we applied each of those to an AI Bananagrams player that we developed.

Game programming:

* Villain Heist:
In this course we were placed into small groups of develeopment teams, where we self assigned roles and 
deliverables to create a small video game demo. I worked on the charater and enemy movment, 
the camera system, and the checkpoint system. I also designed and tested the tutorial level of the game. 
I am very proud of what my group was able to come up with.
The game is publicly avaialble, check it out here: https://impostorfrogs.itch.io/villain-heist

Fundies 2:
    
* 10Bullets:
This was the midterm assigmnet and our first real dive into user input. Very simple game 
but at the time was tough to figure out. Based on the original game of the same title.

* Flood It:
This assignment was towards the end of the semester in Fundies 2 when I really began 
to be pulled into my programming projects. Once again this is based on the orignal game of the same title. 

* Maze:
The final assigmnet of my Fundies 2 course. For this assignment we had to do a lot of learning on our own 
which I really enjoyed. I had to research finding algorithms, data structures, 
and learn some new drawing capaibilites to make this possible.
    
Object-Oriented Design:

* Marble Solitiare:
We spent the first three weeks of this six week course on this assignment. This is the first time we were 
graded on our code's style. I learned a lot about how to write code that is readable and easy to build upon 
during this project. Based on the original game of the same title.

* Image Processor:
We spent the last three weeks on this image processing assignment with partners. The entire process for this 
project was very time consuming but very educational. Because of this assignment I now have a firmer grasp 
on good design and a much better understanding of UI and how to develop it.
