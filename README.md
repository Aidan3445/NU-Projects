# NU-Projects
Projects from my courses at Northeastern that I'm proud of. Organized by course.

Fundies 2:
    
    10Bullets:
        This was the midterm assigmnet and our first real dive into user input. Very simple game but at the time was tough to figure out.
        Based on the original game of the same title.

    Flood It:
        This assignment was towards the end of the semester in Fundies 2 when I really began to be pulled into my programming projects.
        Once again this is based on the orignal game of the same title. 

    Maze:
        The final assigmnet of my Fundies 2 course. For this assignment we had to do a lot of learning on our own which I really enjoyed.
        I had to research finding algorithms, data structures, and learn some new drawing capaibilites to make this possible.
               
    
Object-Oriented Design:

    Marble Solitiare:
        We spent the first three weeks of this six week course on this assignment. This is the first time we were harshly graded on style.
        I learned a lot about how to write code that is readable and easy to build on during this project.
        Based on the original game of the same title.
        
    Image Processor:
        We spent the last three weeks on this image processing assignment with partners. The entire process for this project was very time consuming
        but very educational. Because of this assignment I now have a firm grasp on good design and a much better understanding of UI.
